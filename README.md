# Naxi Dongba Symbols Dataset

A dataset of Naxi Dongba Symbols.

本repo计划收集整理存放收集东巴文文字的图像，可用于机器学习或者其他任何可能的用途。

This repo is supposed to collect and store multiple images of each Dongba character, which might be helpful to machine learning or any other possible uses. 



Let's work together to help make Dongba symbols known to the world.


## Wikis

In fact you can find all these and much MORE **by googling it yourself**. I'm just pasting some links which I thought might be useful.

The entry on **Wikipedia** is quite informative. If you'd like to dig into it, read it thoroughly and check the *External Links* on the page.

|Language|Links|
| --- | --- |
| English | [Dongba symbols - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongba_symbols) |
| 中文    | [东巴文 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/东巴文) |

👉 [纳西东巴文：象形程度很高(图)](http://city.sina.com.cn/travel/t/2011-07-21/101020206.html)

I also found a **repo**/website which has an introduction and index for Dongba Script on **GitHub**:

## About Encoding

There is still not a international solution to encode Dongba characters. Please check the links below to gain some insights on it.
